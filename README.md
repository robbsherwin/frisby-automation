I wanted to create an example of an implementation of Frisby.js, which I am using for API automation. 


This requires npm and Node.js to be installed.


To run: 
npm clean
jasmine-node spec/api (will run all spec.js files in that directory. You can just specify a specific file to run a specific file.)
